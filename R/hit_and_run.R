#' Hit and Run 
#' 
#' This function provides a wrapper 
#' for the har function of the 
#' hit-and-run package
#' 
#'@param A is the lhs of Ax <= b
#'@param b is the rhs of Ax <= b
#'@param x0 is the starting point (a list of points)
#'@param points is the number of points we want to sample
#'@param thin every thin-th point is stored
#'@param burn the first burn points are deleted
#'@param chains is the number of chains we run
#' 
#' @return a list of chains of the sampled points, each chain
#'         being a matrix object with each column as a point
