    ## the higher this number is, the more likely our n points will be closer to

    ## the basic idea for having "average" number of points is that the linear
    ## programming method we use below in general finds points that randomly lie
    ## at the bounds of our convex polytope. And thus, if the take "average"
    ## number of points, and then take the average of the boundary points, we
    ## can get a good approximation of the "analytic center" of the space 
    ## however, I am unsure of how many points to average is good
    
    ## it is true that the more points we take, the closer it will be to the 
    ## true mean of whatever distribution this linear programming algorithm 
    ## draws from however, if we want a diversified sample of starting points,
    ## it's probably a good idea to have the "average" on the lower side, so
    ## that they are not close to each other. Also, this number should increase
    ## as the dimension of the problem increases (i.e. number of rows in A)
