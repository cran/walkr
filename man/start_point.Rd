\title{start point}
\usage{
start_point(A, b, n = 1, average = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{is the lhs of \eqn{Ax \le b}}

\item{b}{is the rhs of \eqn{Ax \le b}}

\item{n}{is the number of points we want to return}

\item{average}{is the number of boundary points we want to take the average
of}
}
\value{
a matrix, with each column as a point
}
\description{
Given \eqn{Ax \le b}, which defines a convex
polytope, this function picks n random
starting "center" points using linear programming.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## note that this Ax <= b is different from Ax=b that the 
## user specifies for walkr (see transformation section in vignette) 
start_point(A = A, b = b, n = 1, average = 10) 
}
